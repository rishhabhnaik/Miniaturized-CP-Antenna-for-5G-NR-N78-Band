# Miniaturized-CP-Antenna-for-5G-NR-N78-Band
 
The aim of the project was to implement and simulate a miniaturized CP antenna that operates on the N78 band which can be used in malls, stadiums and airports. The four antennas with different structures described in the paper :   structures as described in the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144409 were implemented.
 
 Overview:  
 1) Designed a novel V-SRR using metallic sheets to support the SRR structure
 2) Realized LP V-SRR antenna
 3) Realized CP single port V-SRR antenna
 4) Dual CP using CRLH-TL feeding
