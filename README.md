# Miniaturized-CP-Antenna-for-5G-NR-N78-Band
 Overview:  
 1) Designed a novel V-SRR using metallic sheets to support the SRR structure
 2) Realized LP V-SRR antenna
 3) Realized CP single port V-SRR antenna

The aim of the project was to implement these structures as described in the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144409
